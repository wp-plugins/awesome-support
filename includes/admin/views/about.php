				<h3>Probably the Best WordPress Support Plugin</h3>
				<p>Awesome Support was created by <a href="http://themeavenue.net" target="_blank">ThemeAvenue</a> to make up for the lack of support plugins for WordPress. The SaaS world has some very good support apps, but we felt that WordPress didn't have a comprehensive solution... until now.</p>
				<p>Since its first release as a commercial plugin 2 years ago, Awesome Support has gained quite a lot of traction. In 2014, we chose to change the way we distribute this plugin and in doing so, re-built it from scratch and have decided to release it for free to the WordPress community. Now anyone can have a powerful support site for free. No monthly costs or set-up fees - Awesome Support is yours to own forever.</p>

				<h3>Seamless Integration</h3>
				<p>Awesome Support is built in a way that makes it compatible with 99% of all existing themes, be it free or commercial.</p>
				<p>This plugin is "plug &amp; play": all settings and templates are ready to work as soon as you clicked the "Activate" button.</p>
				<p>Some theme authors took the integration one step further by using the built-in templating system to perfectly match their theme's style.</p>

				<h3>Provide Awesome Support for Free</h3>
				<p>The plugin gives you access to tools that web apps usually charge you a lot for. Everything you need is built-in: multiple support agents, unlimited tickets, auto-assignment of tickets to the first available agent, custmizable e-mail notifications, complete ticket history, files attachment...</p>
				<p>If this is not enough, lots of addons are available to add new features for a fraction of what it would cost you with a web app, and you keep complete control over your data and your client's private information.</p>
