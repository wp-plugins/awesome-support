The most advanced support plugin for WordPress. Provide awesome support straight from your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Awesome Support is the most advanced ticketing system for WordPress. It is the result of two years of work, research and improvement. Most of its features are an answer to users requests and that's what makes it the best support plugin for WordPress. For support please visit the [official site](http://getawesomesupport.com).

= Seamless Integration =

Awesome Support was built in a way that makes it compatible with 99% of all existing themes, be it free or commercial. It is "plug & play": all settings and templates are ready to work as soon as you clicked the "Activate" button.

= Responsive Design =

What if your clients need to submit a ticket on the go? No worries! The plugin is responsive. Even from a mobile, your client will have a smooth and pleasant experience (as long as the theme you use is responsive).

= Robust Code =

Version 3 of this support plugin was built with flexibility in mind: the code is clean, well documented and full of hooks. If you need a very custom support system, Awesome Support will let you do almost anything you want. Awesome Support relies on the [Titan Framework](http://www.titanframework.net/) to handle plugin options. This framework is built by expert WordPress developers and well maintained on GitHub.

= What does it do? =

I know you love lists, so here we go. Time for the list:

- **Ticketing**: users submit tickets from the front-end, agents cherish them from the back-end
- **E-mail notifications**: whenever someone does something, the interested parties are notified by e-mail and all e-mails are customizable
- **Restricted access**: everything you say is strictly private. It all stays between the client and the agents
- **File upload**: you control when files can be uploaded, haw many and how big
- **Multiple products**: provide support for as manu products as you want
- **Custom fields**: need more fields? You have full control over it
- **Terms & conditions**: ask users to approve your terms before they can raise a ticket
- **Old tickets**: identify old tickets in a second thanks to the tags

= Extensions =

We packed a whole bunch of features in Awesome Support. Once activated, you're ready to provide world-class support. If you want to go even further though, we've got you covered: dozens of addons will allow you to extend the plugin's possibilities and gain in productivity. To check out the available addons please visit the official site [getawesomesupport.com](http://getawesomesupport.com).
